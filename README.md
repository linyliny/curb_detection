# curb_detection
This code is based on the paper A real-time curb detection and tracking method for UGVs by using a 3D-LIDAR sensor.

We built this code for the real-world using. A velodyne 64-Lidar was putted on our auto-vehicle. The pointcloud will published from the ROS. So our code is based the ROS environment. And after the curb points are detected, we also will publish these points using ROS, for the using of our next steps.

This code is the raw edition with the method from the paper. we open this source just for the friends who want try this method.
